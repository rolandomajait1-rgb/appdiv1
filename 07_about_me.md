## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

I want to learn Git and GitHub because they are helpful when it comes to managing and tracking code, and it is required for software developers, web developers, and professionals in the IT industry. They also make it easier to work and collaborate with other people on the same project. With GitHub, I can store my code online, share it, and even work on projects with others around the world. Learning these tools will help me become a more effective and organized developer.
